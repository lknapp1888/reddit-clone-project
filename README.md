## Project aims

The aim of this project was to build a fairly large scale full stack application that would both develop my competencies in important areas while also displaying my ability to create a web application that includes user authorisation, CRUD functionality, persistent back end data storage/structuring and various other competencies as required.

I chose loosely replicate a 'lite' version of reddit as this posed some additional challenges beyond, for instance, a blog application, such as:

- Posts with nested comments
- User community (sub-reddit) creation
- An upvote/downvote system.
- Various filtering/sorting features - e.g. all communities, subscribed communities, sorted by vote/post date

## Technologies used

- React
- Firebase
- Chakra UI
- redux

## Outcomes

- A proven ability to produce a full stack web application persistent CRUD operations and a variety of features.
- Improved understanding of data/document structure and storage.
- Improved understanding of user authorisation and conditional user rendering.
- Improved ability with Chakra UI to quickly produce styled components
- Improved understanding of state management using redux
- Increased experience with REACT, particular with creating a large REACT application from scratch.
- Evident ability with firebase, particularly usage of authentication, database, hosting and security rules.
- Proven problem solving abilities considering the many challenges that arise with a larger scale web-application, particularly with areas or concepts that I had not encountered before.

## Challenges/potential improvements

The project was certainly challenging due to it's scale and some of the new concepts, but this did mean it was a valuable learning process. Some challenges and potential improvements were/are:

- Actually deciding on a broad file structure, dependencies and application component structure - the latter could be improved with better component re-usability.
- Deciding on how best to structure the data (users, posts, comments and communities).
- Improvement - permanently storing upvote/downvote data on server (currently only client side and does not persist)
- Improvement - more testing.
